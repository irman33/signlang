# SignLang

Website to help learn to recite the sign language alphabet backwards

For myself personally, this was a quick excersise in coding vanilla javascript with separation of concerns. 

## Controls

Either click on, or press the Keys to play video for each letter.
Use <- and -> arrow keys to step through alphabet. Use (up arrow) to play current letter video
